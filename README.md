## Installation
The libraries required for the successful execution of this code are mentioned in requirements.txt. In order to install all the libraries:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
## Do One Thing
If you are doing your project using juypter Notebook, Then upload `utils.py` file in your notebook, and then start doing code.
## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to 2019 in order to better understand:

- What programming languages are on the rise during the previous three years?
- How does the education level affects the salary, job and career satisfaction?
- Does the number of people who desire to work in a particular language accurately predicts its rise in the following year?
- What does the developers in general think of higher management?
## File Descriptions
The repository contains 4 individual notebooks, each answering the above mentioned questions. They contain exploratory data analysis with a separate notebook for predicting salary.

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://prakashmandekar8.medium.com/how-to-be-the-best-developer-of-all-time-63dc9ece069e).
